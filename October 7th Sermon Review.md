_The point of Holidays is to remember._ _The 14th & 15th of Adar, was March 24h & 25th of this year._  
Queen Esther makes this a law of the Medes of the Persians that the Jews would be able to practice this holiday annually. The purpose was to remember these events. Haman planed the Jewish destruction, but God in His sovereignty preserved them through Mordaci and Esther. Purim means "Lots". In the OT they used the casting of Lots to make decisions. This Lots that were cast were the Lots Haman cast, but it turned out good for the Jews and negative towards Haman. **Proverbs 16:33** - _Have someone read_

# Why Regular Remembrance is a good value:

Life goes on, in between celebrating these two days of feasts. The Jews were still under this horrible King. The Jews still needed protection, they still faced threats. They still needed to remember. When we are suffering, hardships consume our thoughts. We often overthink about our hardships, and forget the blessings and good things. We need to remember.
